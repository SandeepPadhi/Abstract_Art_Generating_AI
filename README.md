# Abstract_Art_Generating_AI
The project is Abstract Art Generating AI built using Tensorflow produces Awesome Abstract Images given Input Images.
The underlining Algorithm used is Generative Adverserial Network.

Directory Structure:
1) Images - This should contain input images in format design1.jpeg,design2.jpeg and so on.The Images directory must contain 20 images.The program must be run
            on Google Colab.You must upload the Images Directory before running the program on colab.The command for uploading the file can found at the 
            Abstract_Art_Generating_AI.ipynb file
2)Output - This directory contains sample output that the program would generate.

ENJOY..!!!
